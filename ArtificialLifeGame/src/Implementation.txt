The Project is in MVC:
    The GUI for the menu is in the Menu Class
    The Controllers for the menu is in the MenuController Class
    The GUI for the game is in the GameView Class
    The Controllers for the game is in the GameController Class


World has an 2 arraylists:
    1)that stores an arraylist of Regions(world).
    2)that stores movable Entities(movableEntities)

    A Region contains the terrain type and the entity on it.
    entities.txt ->  '_'= Empty/Null ,'A'=agent ,'b'=Bush ,'C'=Carnivore,'H'= Herbivore ,'B'=Base ,'R'= Rock ,'T'= Tree
    terrain.txt -> ',' = Grass,'.' = Dirt/Dessert,'~' = Water

    Carnivore = Random computed set of {Lion(L), Wolf(W)}
    Herbivore = Random computed set of {Rabbit(r), Monkey(m)}

All Creatures have Vision
    Vision -> 'x'= Not Available , and other characters are the same character from Entities.txt & Terrain.txt
    Creatures move based on their vision & terrain restrictions & health

Console Implementation:
The Console Code for the View & Controls are in the GameView class
//TODO: Convert console code to JavaFX GameController & GameView GUI
