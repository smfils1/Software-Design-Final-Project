Current Implementation:

The Project is in MVC:

World has an 2 arraylists:
    1)that stores an arraylist of Regions(world).
    2)that stores movable Entities(movableEntities)

    A Region contains the terrain type and the entity on it.
    entities.txt ->  '_'= Empty/Null ,'A'=agent ,'b'=Bush ,'C'=Carnivore,'H'= Herbivore ,'B'=Base ,'R'= Rock ,'T'= Tree
    terrain.txt -> ',' = Grass,'.' = Dessert,'~' = Water

    Carnivore = Random computed set of {Lion(L), Wolf(W)}
    Herbivore = Random computed set of {Rabbit(r), Monkey(m)}

    The world also has a Time that stores the current time in seconds, how long is a full day (the cycle), and if it's day or night.

All Creatures have Vision
    Vision -> 'x'= Not Available , and other characters are the same character from Entities.txt & Terrain.txt
    Creatures move based on their vision & terrain restrictions & health.
    At night the Agent has night vision and can only see within its square-block radius.
